<rough instruction - to be edited>
Set up project on Linux (should be similar on Mac):
Prerequisites:
	virtualenv (https://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenv)
	python (ver 2.7)

Checkout the repo:
$ git pull blah blah blah

We will make a virtual environment for the libraries, frameworks that are
required for the Python backend to run. Pros: no dependencies mess, everything
is encapsulated in the virtual environment, no actual install to the machine.

On terminal go to this folder: sp2013cs487-team-b/src/web_backend/
Create a virtual environment. The command will create a folder name env:
$ virtualenv --no-site-packages env

Tell the terminal where to look for executable files:
$ source env/bin/activate
(The reverse command is '$ deactivate')

Now when we run '$ python', The python file that get called is the one inside
env, not the global one. Make sure you get 2.7.x when running '$ python --version'.
(if not, email me).

Install Flask and other libraries into env:
$ pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the webapp on local server at 127.0.0.1:
$ python run_server.py
Go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 on a web browser to see if it works.

I will try to complete this guide with instructions for Windows. However, I'm really
grateful if any of you figure out how to set this up for Windows and edit this.

-----------
Some note about the local server:
Flask has a built-in server for development. That is what the webapp running on
with this configuration on your local machine.
